# Preliminaries for Using Marlowe

The [demeter.run](https://demeter.run/) web3 development platform provides an extension *Cardano Marlowe Runtime* that has Marlowe tools installed and makes available the Marlowe Runtime backend services and a Cardano node. No setting of environment variables or installation of tools or running of backend services is needed when using Demeter Run's Cardano Marlowe Runtime extension.
