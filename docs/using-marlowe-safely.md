## Using Marlowe Safely

If one plans to run a Marlowe contract on the Cardano `mainnet`, then one should check its safety before creating it, so that there is no chance of losing funds.

Here are the steps for checking the safety of a Marlowe contract:

1. Understand the [Marlowe Language](https://marlowe.iohk.io/).
2. Understand Cardano\'s [Extended UTxO Model](https://docs.cardano.org/learn/eutxo-explainer).
3. Read and understand the [Marlowe Best Practices Guide](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/blob/main/marlowe/best-practices.md).
4. Read and understand the [Marlowe Security Guide](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/blob/main/marlowe/security.md).
5. Use [Marlowe Playground](https://play.marlowe.iohk.io) to flag warnings, perform static analysis, and simulate the contract.
6. Use [Marlowe CLI\'s](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/blob/main/marlowe-cli/ReadMe.md) `marlowe-cli run analyze` tool to study whether the contract can run on a Cardano network.
7. Run *all execution paths* of the contract on a [Cardano testnet](https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-testnet/overview).
